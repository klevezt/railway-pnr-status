        <strong>What is PNR?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        ​PNR is short name for 'Passenger Name Record'. It is a record in the
        database of Indian Railways against which the journey details for a
        passenger, or a group of passengers are stored. Centre for Railway
        Information Systems (CRIS) also maintains information like current PNR
        status of the passengers, availability of berths in all classes for the
        next 60 days and static enquiries like Train Between Important Stations,
        Reservations Rules, Fares, Refund, and Rules etc When a reserved railway
        ticket is booked for a train in Indian Railways, all the details of
        passengers are stored in relational database of centralized reservation
        system. These details are associated with a unique ten digit number.
        This reference number is called PNR. PNR number is generally printed at
        the top left corner of the printed tickets. In case of the E – Ticket,
        it is mentioned at top in separate cell. Passenger's personal
        information like name, age, gender etc. is saved in the database against
        this reference number. It includes columns to store booking status and
        current status of the ticket. As we know every train has limited number
        of seats, sometime one may not get a confirmed reserved ticket. The
        current status of such a waitlist (W/L) ticket changes when there is any
        availability of reserved seats due to cancellation. This new current
        reservation status is generally known as PNR status.

        PNR is an abbreviation for 'Passenger Name Record'. As the term
        suggests, when you book a ticket, an entry is created in your name and a

        ‘PNR number’. This id is the key to figure a variety of information
        about your train reservation. For instance, PNR status tells you if
        booking is confirmed or you’ll need to wait to get a seat if someone
        cancels their ticket. Apart from booking confirmation, you also get to
        know the details of the train coach and berth, the fare paid by you, and
        the departure and arrival date and timelines. What’s more, you can check
        the PNR status using your smartphone too. Below explains how you could

        <strong>Modes of PNR enquiry and how does it work?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You must be wondering what’s the mechanics behind a PNR enquiry; what
        are all the modes to enquire PNR and how does it work across channels.
        Well, here is all you need to know about it. In this era, you need not
        physically visit a railway station to make an enquiry to know the status
        of your ticket. You can very much do it using modern enquiry modes such
        as smartphone applications, web portals, via SMS, and final reservation
        charts of course. Now, the HOW part of it - when you buy a ticket using
        IRCTC portal or over the counter or via any third-party ticketing
        platform for that matter, a 10-digit number is generated. This number
        stores all the information about your train journey at CRIS (Centre Of
        Railway Information Systems), a database meant for storing passenger
        details. When you make an online PNR status enquiry, this number fetches
        the live PNR status from the database. You can reserve up to 6 seats in
        a single transaction and the online PNR status is going to show the
        reservation details of 6 of them. You may carry out another transaction
        to book tickets beyond six, if need be. An SMS service was launched
        initially by IRCTC to get live PNR status on your mobile. To avail this
        service all you have to do is, send a message to the service number in
        the following format: PNR space "Your PNR Number".

        <strong>Understanding IRCTC PNR Status Abbreviations</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The abbreviations found on a PNR number status page or on a ticket could
        read alien and you might wonder what do these terms mean? Here is help.
        Here’s a list of some abbreviated terms, their meaning and full forms
        that they stand for:
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; CNF – If you read this on your live PNR status, you’ve got
        a ‘Confirmed’ ticket
        <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; RAC – ‘Reservation Against Cancellation’ meaning that you
        are likely to get reservation in case someone cancels to travel. You can
        board the train though
        <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; WL – ‘Waiting List’ meaning that you’re lined up to get a
        confirmed ticket only if one decides to cancel their booking. If the
        chart has been prepared and your IRCTC PNR status still says WL, you
        cannot board the train. There are other types of waiting lists as well
        including GNWL (General Waitlist), TQWL (Tatkal Waitlist), PQWL (Pooled
        Quota Waitlist), RLWL (Remote Location Waitlist), and NOSB (No Seat
